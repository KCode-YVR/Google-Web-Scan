## Google-Web-Scan
# A simple WHOIS parser google extension.

This application offers the general public a quick, surface-level security check on any website by using a WHOIS parser. A WHOIS scan retrieves publicly available domain registration records, revealing key details such as the domain's creation date, the registrant's contact information, and name server data. Users can leverage this information to assess a site's reputation: a newly registered domain or inconsistent contact information can be a significant red flag, while a long-established domain and transparent registration details suggest legitimacy. The tool provides valuable transparency to help users quickly gauge the trustworthiness and history of a website.

This app is a google web extension which allow users to: 
- open the extension on their web browser
- run a whatis scanner to all website that are currently on their screen by pressing a scan button
- view a summary of the scan which would include a list of safe websites and a list of unsafe website
- check each website's whatis data
