## Google-Web-Scan
# A simple WHOIS parser google extension.

This application offers the general public a quick, surface-level security check on any website by using a WHOIS parser. A WHOIS scan retrieves publicly available domain registration records, revealing key details such as the domain's creation date, the registrant's contact information, and name server data. Users can leverage this information to assess a site's reputation: a newly registered domain or inconsistent contact information can be a significant red flag, while a long-established domain and transparent registration details suggest legitimacy. The tool provides valuable transparency to help users quickly gauge the trustworthiness and history of a website.

This app is a google web extension which allow users to: 
- open the extension on their web browser
- run a whoois scanner to the current website that they are currently on the "scan" button
- view an assessment of the website which includes the domain name, the risk score provided by the program, a classification: "safe", "be wary", "unsafe", and the reasons to why it got the risk score
- view some of the whois data: creation date, expiration date, registrar, and name servers

Still being updated:)
